# Predict BTC Using Time Series Models
Using data obtained from a free API, we fitted a time series model on the hourly return in USD value of BTC. We chose a seasonal ARIMA model as the final model, and used it to implement a simple trading strategy. Returns were mixed, but it is a good starting point for building out a full-fledged algorithmic trading strategy.
